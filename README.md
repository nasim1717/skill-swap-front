Skill Swap Platform
Overview
Skill Swap Platform is a full-stack web application designed to connect users who want to exchange skills with one another. Users can list the skills they can offer and the skills they want to learn, get matched with others based on complementary skills, and communicate via a real-time chat system. The platform is built using Laravel for the backend, React (with Inertia.js) or Next.js for the frontend, and MySQL for the database, ensuring a robust and scalable solution. The UI is designed with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui for a modern, responsive experience, incorporating lucide-react icons for enhanced aesthetics.
This project showcases full-stack development skills, including authentication, database management, real-time features, and responsive UI design, making it an ideal portfolio piece for demonstrating proficiency in modern web development technologies.
